# Advent of code 2022

This repository contains my solutions for [advent of code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).
This years solutions are implemented in TypeScript. 

## Running

Checkout the project and run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.
Afterwards run `npm build` to build the project and `node ./build/challenges/index.js` to execute the challenges.
The solutions should be printed into the console.

## Testing
Testing is done with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). To execute the tests run `npm run test`.

## Formatting
Run `npm run fix` to enforce "Google TypeScript Style" code formatting.
